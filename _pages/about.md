## 🔎 About Me

I'm an M.Tech graduate in Data Science from IIT Madras (2024), and hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from VIT (2022). I previously worked as a Project Associate at RBCDSAI, IIT Madras, under the guidance of Prof. B. Ravindran.

My research interests focus on reinforcement learning (RL), especially its applications to large language models (LLMs).

*   🔭 **Current Focus:** Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models (RL for LLMs)  
*   🤝 **Open to Collaboration:** Projects involving RL, LLMs, Causality, and Multi-Agent Systems  
*   💬 **Expertise Areas:** Machine Learning · Deep Learning · Computer Vision · Natural Language Processing (NLP) · Reinforcement Learning
